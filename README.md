# react-drag-capture
A convenience React component for succinctly managing positions of multiple mouse
and touch pointers.

A pointer is tracked once a `touchstart` or `mousedown` event occurs within the
`DragCapture` element, and continues to be tracked until the corresponding `mouseup`
or `touchend` event occurs. **Notably, a pointer continues to be tracked even when
dragged outside of the `DragCapture` element.**

```javascript
import { DragCapture, RelativeDragCapture } from '@davidisaaclee/react-drag-capture';

// `position`s from `DragCapture` will be client position of pointer
<DragCapture
  dragDidBegin={(pointerID, position) => console.log(`${pointerID}: Began drag at (${position.x}, ${position.y})`)}
  dragDidMove={(pointerID, position) => console.log(`${pointerID}: Moved drag at (${position.x}, ${position.y})`)}
  dragDidEnd={(pointerID, position) => console.log(`${pointerID}: Ended drag at (${position.x}, ${position.y})`)}
/>

// `position`s from `RelativeDragCapture` will be between (0, 0) and (1, 1), relative to the `RelativeDragCapture` element.
// Top-left of the element is (0, 0), bottom-right is (1, 1).
<RelativeDragCapture
  dragDidBegin={(pointerID, position) => console.log(`${pointerID}: Began drag at (${position.x}, ${position.y})`)}
  dragDidMove={(pointerID, position) => console.log(`${pointerID}: Moved drag at (${position.x}, ${position.y})`)}
  dragDidEnd={(pointerID, position) => console.log(`${pointerID}: Ended drag at (${position.x}, ${position.y})`)}
/>
```

## Features
- Unified API for touch and mouse events
- Multitouch support
- Optional `RelativeDragCapture` component for providing a pointer position
relative to the `RelativeDragCapture`'s bounds
- Automatically disables default touch actions for tracked touches

## Relation to the Pointer Events API
A lot of this component's functionality is more powerfully implemented in the
[Pointer Events API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_events),
specifically when combined with
[`setPointerCapture()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/setPointerCapture).

Unfortunately, as of March 2018, Safari does not fully support this API. There are
a handful of polyfills - most visibly, [PEP](https://github.com/jquery/PEP) from jQuery.
These might be the way to go; but I personally found that using a polyfill made
debugging performance a little confusing. (I'm probably wrong about this!)

**It's important to note that the `pointerId` of a pointer event and the pointer ID
provided by the `DragCapture` props are not guaranteed to be the same.**
